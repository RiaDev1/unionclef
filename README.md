# UnionClef

Letting agents loose in block game.

![Kill&loot](https://github.com/3ndetz/autoclef/assets/30196290/7377ec79-1c3d-493b-9a1d-5d701f19d9c9)


An open platform for building AI agents that play Minecraft — pathfinding, combat, survival, multiplayer. The goal is to make it easy for researchers, developers, and tinkerers to plug their agents into the game and see what happens.

Built by merging **altoclef**, **shredder**, and **tungsten** into a single codebase. No submodules, no pre-built JARs, no tears.

## What's inside

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **altoclef** (root) | Autonomous bot — speedruns, PvP, SkyWars, Python scripting via Py4J |
| **shredder/** | Pathfinder v2 — fork of baritone with WindMouse camera, tungsten integration, human-like movement |
| **tungsten/** | A* pathfinder that doesn't break blocks — complex parkour, follows players, PvP movement |
| ~~baritone/~~ | Legacy pathfinding code, kept as reference. Replaced by shredder |

**Minecraft 1.21** / **Fabric** / **Java 21**

4. Fork: **[3ndetz/autoclef](https://github.com/3ndetz/autoclef)** (multiplayer, SkyWars, Python bridge) →
5. Merged into: **unionclef**

### shredder

Fork of baritone, rebuilt as the primary pathfinder. Keeps `baritone.*` packages for API compatibility but adds WindMouse camera smoothing, human-like movement entropy, and a tungsten bridge that delegates complex parkour segments (no block breaking/placing) to tungsten's A* executor.

1. Origin: **[cabaletta/baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone)** (by leijurv & Brady) →
2. Patched by altoclef maintainers (GauchoMatrero → MiranCZ → 3ndetz) →
3. Remapped mojmap → yarn →
4. Forked as **shredder** with WindMouse + tungsten integration →
5. Merged into: **unionclef**

### baritone (legacy)

Original pathfinding engine. Kept in the repo as reference code — all active pathfinding now goes through shredder.

1. Origin: **[cabaletta/baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone)** (by leijurv & Brady) →
2. Remapped mojmap → yarn & merged into: **unionclef** →
3. Superseded by **shredder**

### tungsten

1. Origin: **[CaptainWutax/Tungsten](https://github.com/CaptainWutax/Tungsten)** →
2. Fork: **[Hackerokuz/Tungsten](https://github.com/Hackerokuz/Tungsten)** (crash fixes, followPlayer) →
3. Fork: **[3ndetz/Tungsten](https://github.com/3ndetz/Tungsten)** (altoclef integration) →
